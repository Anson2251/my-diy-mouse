# My DIY Mouse

This is a little Arduino project I whipped up while messing around with a Joystick module.

The driver is in TypeScript, running on Node.js, because, honestly, Python's mouse emulation was just too slow.

Two buttons are missing for some reason, but that's not a big deal. Iâ€™ll sort that out later.

<u>***THIS PROJECT IS MADE FOR FUN!!!***</u>

***Big thanks to Kino** for the awesome hardware to build this mouse!*
